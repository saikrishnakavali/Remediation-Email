# Vulnerability Remediation Scripts for Testing and Deployment

## Hi Team,

Following our initial vulnerability assessment, we have developed a set of remediation scripts to address key security risks. These scripts are designed for seamless integration into your deployment platform (e.g., SCCM) and should be tested before production deployment.

## Vulnerabilities and Remediations:

1. [Third-Party Software Removal (Wireshark)](https://github.com/saikrishnakavali/Remediation-Scripts/blob/main/Uninstall-Wireshark)
2. [Windows OS Secure Configuration (Insecure Protocols)](https://github.com/saikrishnakavali/Remediation-Scripts/blob/main/toggle-protocols)
3. [Windows OS Secure Configuration (Insecure Ciphersuites)](https://github.com/saikrishnakavali/Remediation-Scripts/blob/main/toggle-cipher-suites)
4. [Windows OS Secure Configuration (Guest Account Group Membership)](https://github.com/saikrishnakavali/Remediation-Scripts/blob/main/toggle-guest-local-administrators)

Please review and test these scripts, and let me know if any modifications are needed.
